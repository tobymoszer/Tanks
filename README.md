# Tanks
A from-scratch re-creation of the popular Wii Play game Tanks in Java with Swing. I wrote enemy tank AI with pathfinding using A star, and real time bullet trajectory calculations with more advanced tanks using banking wall shots more effectively. I also made a level editor for easily implementing the exact level designs from the original game, and creating custom levels.

This needs Java 12 to run for the new switch statements.
